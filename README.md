# greek-keymap

Greek keyboard for technical purposes. A package that allows users to easily enter Greek characters into their text using [AutoHotKey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Features

* Press the `Pause` button on your keyboard to activate the keymap.
* Type the corresponding key combination to generate the desired Unicode character. For example, pressing `d` will input the Greek letter `δ` (delta), but `D` will input `Δ` (Delta).
* For full list of predefined items check the [script.ahk](script.ahk) file.
* The script will wait for up to 1 second for input after every keypress, but you can interrupt it at any time by pressing the `Esc` key.
